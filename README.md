## Usage

This app gives us the option to search with our license plate & state to check if you have any parking tickets or red-camera violations. The data is "live" and being fetched from **NYC Open Data API**. The app was designed with the option to add many more features in the future and fetch additional data . The back-end is a Rails API and PostgreSQL database to persist user data and search query history.Employed cookies/session for authentication and Bcrypt for password encryption.The [front-end](https://github.com/gbs4ever/nyc-client-side)  is built using React.js and Redux for state managment. Have fun using or fork this repo.
